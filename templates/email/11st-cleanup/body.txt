Good Morning {{ first_name }},

Looking forward to meeting all of you tomorrow and cleaning 11th Street!

We will begin at 9am and plan to end at 12pm. Feel free to join us for all or part of the cleanup.

We will set up a table with a Philly Bike Action banner, hopefully in a shady spot, near 1101 Washington Ave. Organizers will be wearing Philly Bike Action shirts: black with green or pink text. 

Expected weather is sunny and mid 70s, perfect for being outdoors for a few hours. Please bring water, hat, sunscreen, and clothes you wouldn’t mind getting dirty. We have a collection of brooms, shovels, gloves, and weeding tools for you to use, but if you have your own gloves or weeding tools, please bring those!

Limited coffee and bagels will be provided by Bart’s Bagels, as well as iced tea and pastries from Guzo Cafe. 

Following the cleanup, Two Robbers Lodge on Fitzwater is hosting us for a little afterparty. Volunteers are welcome to a complimentary vodka soda or draft, and kids are welcome to a free glass of orange juice.

These weeds don’t stand a chance!
