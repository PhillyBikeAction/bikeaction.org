Good Morning {{ first_name }},

Thank you for helping out with our 11th street clean-up. The street is looking so nice and weed free! 

<b>One of our volunteers lost a black backpack with a white Nike logo after the clean-up</b>. If anyone picked it up by accident please let us know so we can help get it back to him.

You can stay up to date about future PBA projects and volunteer opportunities by signing up for a [PBA account](https://bikeaction.org/accounts/signup/) and attending one of our [monthly district meetings](https://bikeaction.org/events/).

See you at the next clean-up!
