Join us for a relaxed-pace Saturday morning \~6mi **bike ride** through beautiful Old City, Society Hill, Washington Square West, Bella Vista, and Queen Village. The route will stick to pretty quiet local streets and touch on some recent and future PBA project areas.

* **WHEN:** Saturday, September 6 @ 10:00 am  
* **WHERE:** start and end at 2nd & Market by entrance to Penn’s Landing

Coffee and snacks provided before the ride. After biking, we encourage everyone to get lunch and shop at the local businesses on Market St—**wear your bike helmets in to visibly demonstrate that you’re part of the cycling community\!**

Please share with your friends\! The more, the merrier\! This is a family-friendly event, so feel free to bring your kids. We want to celebrate the vibrancy of our local community and the Market St corridor.
