Hello {{ profile.user.first_name }},

*You are receiving this email from [Philly Bike Action](https://bikeaction.org/) because you have a PBA account.*

The Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC) is collecting traffic safety concerns in its new [interactive map](https://www.dvrpc.org/webmaps/rvz_crowdsource_map/).

Comments gathered will inform the creation of the Regional Vision Zero (RVZ) plan, which will **identify future traffic safety projects**.

Use the map to report areas of unsafe bike lanes, poor visibility, near miss incidents, and more (on both city and state-owned roads). You can also ‚Äúlike‚Äù üëçand comment on existing concerns that others submitted.

*If you previously filled out the PennDOT Transportation Survey, we recommend adding those same spots to the DVRPC map, and any other dangerous spots.*

Don‚Äôt delay: **the map closes May 23, 2025**\!

Questions on how to add concerns to the map? Reply to this email and we‚Äôll get back to you.
