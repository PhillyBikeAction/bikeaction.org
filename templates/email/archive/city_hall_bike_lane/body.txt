PennDOT is repaving the streets around City Hall this summer, and OTIS will consider adding **safe bike infrastructure** to the inner loop of the traffic circle—but **they need supporting legislation** from City Council, specifically Councilmember Jeffery Young, Jr. (District 5\)

The City Hall bike lane would be the **keystone** of Philly’s bike network—connecting to existing lanes on W Market St, JFK Blvd, 15th St, and a bus–bike lane on E Market, and future lanes on Broad Street and others\!

**City Council must introduce legislation** for a bike lane quickly—or else we’ll miss our chance for a safer Penn Square for years to come. City Council recesses for the summer on **June 12**, so we need Council to write this legislation ASAP.
