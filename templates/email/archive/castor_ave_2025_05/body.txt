Hello {{ first_name }},

Tell the City and PennDOT that you support the Castor Ave Traffic Safety and Beautification [Project](https://www.pa.gov/agencies/penndot/news-and-media/newsroom/district-6/2025/penndot--city-of-philadelphia--septa-to-host-public-meeting-.html)\! Make your voice heard at the open house and town hall on **Wednesday, May 14** at the **Northeast High Cafeteria (1601 Cottman Ave)**. 

Event Schedule: Open House at 4pm, Town Hall at 5pm

We need your support because this project would add the following along a 1.7-mile stretch of Castor Avenue:

- a “road diet” to reduce speeds and calm traffic;  
- curb extensions and boarding islands for SEPTA transit;  
- Parking-separated bike lanes in both directions;  
- ADA compliant curb ramps and sidewalk replacement.

**Traffic safety opponents are [mobilizing](https://metrophiladelphia.com/castor-avenue-project-northeast-philadelphia/) to stop this crucial “Vision Zero” project – we need your support\!** 

During the town hall portion, project organizers will have signs to hold up to make support visible.
