Hello {{ first_name }},

ACTION: Stop Society Hill from giving $25,000 to fight bike lane protection\!

<small><i>You are receiving this email from [Philly Bike Action](https://bikeaction.org/) because you have a PBA account and live in Society Hill.</i></small>

On Wednesday, September 17th the Society Hill Civic Association (SHCA) board **will vote on a motion to donate $25,000 of Civic Association funds to Friends of Pine and Spruce (FOPS)**. **FOPS’ stated goal is to prevent the City from installing physical separation on the Spruce and Pine bike lanes and allow drivers to stop in the bike lane.** They are currently suing the City in a bid to remove the newly installed loading zones and to invalidate the recent No Stopping in the Bike Lane ordinance. They want to use your neighborhood association's money to pay their legal fees. The SHCA motion will be introduced by SHCA board member Paul Boni, **who also serves as general outside counsel to FOPS**—a potential conflict of interest.

**As a resident of Society Hill, we urge you to:**

1. Attend the board meeting on September 17th and speak out against this motion. We recommend bringing proof of residency in Society Hill just in case.  
2. Write an email to the SHCA leadership expressing your disapproval of this motion **before** September 17th.
