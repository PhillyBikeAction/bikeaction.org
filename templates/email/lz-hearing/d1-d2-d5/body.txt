Info on the bills is below.

**Bill [\#250649](https://phila.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7436536&GUID=7DBBE3CB-1FFF-4FFA-931C-0A5D77A8AAEA&Options=ID%7CText%7C&Search=250649) \- Authorizing a bike lane around City Hall**  
In June, your advocacy pushed the City Council to introduce this bill to authorize a new bike lane around City Hall \- road milling started yesterday\! **This bill still needs to be passed into law** **and its future is uncertain**, which is why we need lots of support. This bill will be heard around 3pm if you need to come late.

**Bill \#[250718](https://phila.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7658556&GUID=038EF49D-006E-4FF7-A379-792B6B358A63&Options=ID%7CText%7C&Search=250718) \- Clarifying legality of loading zones in Center City (Spruce & Pine)**  
A lawsuit aimed at stopping the installation of protected bike lanes along Spruce and Pine Street has called into question the legality of loading zones in Philadelphia. This bill will nullify the main   thrust of that lawsuit by explicitly authorizing loading zones in Center City. **Opponents of the protected bike lanes will use the opportunity to argue against bike lane protection.** We need your voice in support of a safer Spruce and Pine street in Center City.

Monday’s hearing will also feature two other bills related to street safety:

* **Bill \#[250770](https://phila.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7664638&GUID=2800E711-F600-4FB3-9257-0E3C7EB54CAE&Options=ID%7CText%7C&Search=250770)** \- Authorizing **automated speed enforcement** cameras on Erie Ave, Allegheny Ave, and Columbus Blvd.  
* **Bill \#[250712](https://phila.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7658550&GUID=2F94D6C8-EDA8-4987-9E00-AACAA72B0322&Options=ID%7CText%7C&Search=)** \- Authorizing the Streets Department to establish loading zones to support the new **47th street protected bike lane**.

Our ally organization 5th Square is coordinating comments on all four bills. We encourage you to [RSVP with 5th Square](https://www.5thsq.org/city_council_sept25) to receive updates and comment suggestions.
