This week, Harry Fenton—a regular attendee at PBA District 1 meetings and a Washington Square West resident—was [struck and killed by a driver](https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/man-hit-killed-car-crash-fairmount-park-west-philadelphia-tuesday/4262851/) while riding his bike in Fairmount Park. **These crashes are preventable** and are a tragic reminder of the need for protected bicycle infrastructure across all of Philadelphia. 

Tell city leaders: no half measures, carve-outs, or exceptions along the Spruce and Pine bike lanes. **Every block of Spruce and Pine, and every Philadelphian, deserves protection.** 

**Join us Friday, September 5th on the Art Museum Steps at 5:45 PM for a brief rally followed by a ride to City Hall**. We will take a moment of silence to honor Harry before the ride. 

Feel free to bring signs for your bike or show up early to make one with our supplies. Indego stations are available near the [start](https://maps.app.goo.gl/97Jx6KuzkxWxSkYC8) and [end](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ek8XDNo4cNsLBPZ7A) of the ride. The Art Museum is easily accessible via the Schuylkill River Trail.

Please share the ride information with family, friends, and neighbors.
