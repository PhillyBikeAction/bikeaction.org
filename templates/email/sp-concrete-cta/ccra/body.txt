Hello {{first_name}},

**Concrete bike lane protection for ALL of Spruce and Pine is in jeopardy.** We need YOU to take two important actions *(scroll down for instructions\!)*:

* **Email Center City Residents Association** to say that their opposition to bike lane protection does not reflect your views as a resident by sending this pre-filled email:

* **SAVE THE DATE:** We're hitting the streets to ride for CONCRETE NOW, EVERY BLOCK on **Friday September 5**. Start: Art Museum steps, meet 5:45pm. End: City Hall (North). [Please RSVP](https://bikeaction.org/events/ride-concrete-now-every-block/).


*What could concrete protection look like?*

The anti-bike opposition group suing the City has **leaked** an [internal city memo](https://prod.cdn.bikeaction.org/images/20250605_spruce_pine_plan_otis_recco_leak.original.jpg) revealing OTIS's preliminary recommendation to **install concrete curb protection** on **ONLY HALF of the Spruce and Pine** **bike lanes**\--compromising everyone’s safety for the convenience of a vocal minority.

Meanwhile, **Center City Residents Association** (CCRA), a group that represents your neighborhood, **is opposing bike lane protection** and is fighting to continue the practice of “temporary stopping” in bike lanes. Their opposition has resulted in **only 5 blocks** of protection on Spruce and **no protection of Pine** within CCRA’s boundaries.

**If you believe CCRA is not representing your voice**, we need you to tell them\! 

CCRA talking points:

* CCRA opposed the No Stopping in the Bike Lane bill without consulting its membership; if you think people shouldn’t stop in bike lanes, mention this\!  
* CCRA is opposing all Loading Zones in our neighborhood. If you find Loading Zones useful to load/unload, mention this, especially if you live on Spruce/Pine.  
* CCRA aims to “speak for the neighborhood” and is focused on growing their membership. If their stance on this issue makes you feel they are not speaking for you, or is making you reconsider membership, tell them\!  
* CCRA is particularly concerned with the voice of CCRA members; if you’re a dues-paying member of CCRA, mention this\!

Send this **pre-filled sample email** **to CCRA** and add your comment:
