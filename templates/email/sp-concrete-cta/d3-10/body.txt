Hello {{first_name}},

**Concrete bike lane protection for ALL of Spruce and Pine is in jeopardy.** We need YOU to take two important actions *(scroll down for instructions\!)*:

* **Email Council President Johnson** to reject the proposed half-measure:

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  <a class="submit-button" href="https://bikeaction.org/maillink/view/cta-concrete/?{{maillinks_params}}">Send Email to Johnson</a>
</div>

* **Save the date** for a ride demanding concrete now, every block on Sept 5\!

*What could concrete protection look like?*

The anti-bike opposition group suing the City has **leaked** an [internal city memo](https://prod.cdn.bikeaction.org/images/20250605_spruce_pine_plan_otis_recco_leak.original.jpg) revealing OTIS's recommendation to **install concrete curb protection** on **ONLY HALF of the Spruce and Pine** **bike lanes**\--compromising everyone’s safety for the convenience of a vocal minority.

**This is a preliminary plan**. Council President Johnson and Councilmember Squilla still need to review and approve the plan before it’s finalized. *This is their opportunity to prioritize safety over people parking in the bike lane.* **We need YOU to ask Council President Johnson to reject this recommendation and insist on protecting every block.** 

Here is a **pre-filled sample email** you can add your comment:

Optional talking points:

* Unprotected blocks will **continue to have serious or fatal crashes.**  
* Impatient drivers will use the unprotected bike lane to pass other cars.  
* Leaving some blocks unprotected will not create the **"protected bike network" that is crucial for safe routes**, especially for children.  
* Concrete curb separation is a proven, data-backed safety measure **that does not require "testing**".  
* Support is not evenly divided. 7,000 people signed our [two petitions](https://bikeaction.org/documents/66/Bike_Lane_Petition_Cover_Pages_03_11_25_2.pdf), 668 people filled out [supportive postcards](https://bikeaction.org/campaign/spruce-pine-postcards/), and 368 respondents at the public open house [supported the plan](http://instagram.com/p/DFq29HPR7Qv/?hl=en&img_index=1) by a margin of **5:1.**

<i>**SAVE THE DATE:** We're hitting the streets to ride for CONCRETE NOW, EVERY BLOCK on **Friday September 5**. Start: Art Museum steps, meet 5:45pm. End: City Hall (North). [Please RSVP](https://bikeaction.org/events/ride-concrete-now-every-block/).</i>
